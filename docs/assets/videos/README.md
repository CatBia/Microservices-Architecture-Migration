# Video Assets

## Background Video

To use the Pexels video (ID: 3129595) as a background:

1. **Download the video** from: https://www.pexels.com/download/video/3129595/
2. **Rename it** to `background-video.mp4`
3. **Place it** in this directory (`docs/assets/videos/`)

The HTML will automatically use the local file as a fallback if the Pexels CDN URL is not accessible.

## Video Specifications

- **Format**: MP4
- **Recommended**: Optimized for web (compressed, reasonable file size)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or similar
- **Duration**: Loop-friendly (short clip that loops seamlessly)

## Alternative: Using Direct Pexels URL

If you prefer to use the Pexels CDN directly, the video source in `index.html` will attempt to load from:
`https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/3129595/pexels-videos-3129595.mp4`

If this URL doesn't work, you can:
1. Download the video and host it locally (recommended for GitHub Pages)
2. Or find the correct Pexels CDN URL for this specific video
